 The search button ,New Ticket and ALL tickets buttons are working.
 The Update and Delete are not working as it returns 405 message saying Im not allowed to use PUT and DELETE methods
 
 In the netlify app it isn't fetching the data. Although on my machine, I'm able to see the data using search button.
I have uploaded the code nevertheless.I have attached a screenshot in the github url to show how the tickets data is displayed at my end on my PC.
